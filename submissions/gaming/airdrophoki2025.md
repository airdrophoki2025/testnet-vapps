Project: Soundness Puzzle

Category: gaming

Description

Soundness Puzzle is a small browser game where players drag and drop tiles to complete an image.
It’s built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can run instantly in any browser — no installs, no wallets, no accounts.

The idea is to keep it simple and enjoyable while showing that vApps don’t always need heavy blockchain logic.
Sometimes, a clean design and a fun mechanic are enough to make people smile and still fit into the Soundness ecosystem.

SL Integration

Doesn’t use complex onchain logic.

Shows that Soundness Layer can also host lightweight, frontend-only projects.

Focus is on user experience and creativity rather than technical complexity.

Anything else?

This project is mainly a way for me to learn and get involved.
I want to keep it fun and light, but I’m also excited to see how far it can go with feedback from the community.
Later on, I’d like to try adding multiplayer or verifiable gameplay once the basics are working well.
