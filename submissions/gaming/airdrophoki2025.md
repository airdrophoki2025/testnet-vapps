Project Title & Category

Project: Soundness Puzzle

Category: Gaming

Summary

PuzzlePlay is a lightweight browser game where players drag and drop tiles to complete an image.
Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs instantly in any browser — no installs, no wallets, and no accounts required.

The goal is to highlight that vApps don’t always need complex blockchain logic. Even small, playful projects can provide value by delivering enjoyable user experiences while still fitting into the Soundness Layer vision.

Problem

Most Web3 projects focus heavily on technical complexity, leaving casual users behind. There is a lack of fun, instantly accessible apps that show the lighter side of decentralized ecosystems.
